# Go in Haskell

My attempt to model go so I could ultimately play with strategies.

Didn't get too far with this one. The pieces are mostly there,
I think, to put together an interactive game between two human
players. The diagramming program would be more useful if there
were an external format for a game, and more indications of
the latest move on a board, scoring, etc.

There's a sample game history SVG file in `images`. I'd put it
here but it needs to be converted to PNG and I'm temporarily
unable to remember how to do it!
